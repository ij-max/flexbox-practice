            UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI
            design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing,
            interactive interfaces.

      <h1>The Difference Between UX and UI Design - A Beginner's Guide</h1>
      <p>
        We've all overheard conversations, walking down hip streets of the
        world's tech capitals, discussions about the great 'UX' of a product, or
        the poor 'UI' of a website. Is it a secret language you will never be
        privy to? Are these people just using slang to look cool? Well, ok,
        probably yes to the latter, but a determinate NO to the rest. If you're
        keen to learn what exactly UX and UI mean and how they differ, you've
        come to the right place. Below is a breakdown of what we're going to
        cover in this article. Read on to learn what the terms UX and UI even
        mean, which of the two areas of design are better paid, and how to
        become a UX designer or UI designer.

      <h2>What are UX and UI in the first place?</h2>
      <p>
        First things first: What do UX and UI actually mean? The people you have
        eavesdropped on are actually discussing two professions that, despite
        having been around for decades, and in theory for centuries, have been
        defined by the tech industry as UX and UI design. UX design refers to
        the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for “user interface
        design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely
        together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles
        themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of
        the product development process and the design discipline. Before we
        consider the key differences between UX and UI, let’s first define what
        each term means individually.
