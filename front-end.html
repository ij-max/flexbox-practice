          <h1>Front-End Development</h1>
          <p>
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is
            the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or
            Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
            directly.

      <h1>What Is a Front-End Developer?</h1>
      <p>
        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
        practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
        Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
        challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
        techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly
        and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
        developing. The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the
        users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy
        to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users
        now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and
        resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these
        aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site
        comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different
        operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device),
        which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

      <h3>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript:</h3>
      <p>
        A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications
        using web technologies (i.e., HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run
        on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web
        platform environments (i.e., React Native). Typically, a person enters
        into the field of front-end development by learning to develop HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript which commonly runs in a web browser but can also
        run in a headless browser, WebView, or as compilation input for a native
        runtime environment. These four run times scenarios are explained below.

      <h3>Web Browsers (most common)</h3>
      <p>
        A web browser is software used to retrieve, present, and traverse
        information on the WWW. Typically, browsers run on a desktop or laptop
        computer, tablet, or phone, but as of late a browser can be found on
        just about anything (i.e, on a fridge, in cars, etc.). The most common
        web browsers are (shown in order of most used first):
        <ol>
            <li>Chrome</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li> internet explorer</li>
            <li>firefox</li>
            <li> edge</li>
        </ol>
